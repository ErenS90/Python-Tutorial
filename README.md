# Python-Tutorial
Tbh I am new to this and I don't think sharing some practise codes would need any license. <br/>
Feel free to refer to the codes I am sharing.


Order:<br/>
1. Introduction to Python. <br/>
2. Conditionals and Loops. <br/>
3. Patterns. <br/>
4. More on Loops. <br/>
5. Functions. <br/>
6. Arrays & Lists. <br/>
7. Searching & Sorting. <br/>
8. Strings. <br/>
9. Two Dimensional Lists. <br/>
10. Tuples, Dictionary And Sets. <br/>

Note! 9th one is incomplete and I haven't done 10th one entirely. <br/>
Well I won't make any excuses, I lost all motivation to complete them and the further ones. I have many things to learn (they include the similar and advanced content) but I was still trying to complete this one and then move further. Sigh ... I ended up wasting a lot of time because of that. So, now I will learn the new topics and will upload them later on.
